imfeat: Image Feature Descriptor Library for Python
License: GPLv3 (except for third party libraries which have their own licenses)

Goal: Standardize image feature descriptors to facilitate reuse

Requirements:
fftw3
cython

Definition of an Image Feature
- A python module that has a "make_features" function
- Takes a PIL image as it's argument
- It returns a list of image features (in the form of numpy arrays)
- List may contain zero, one, or many features
- If a fatal error occurs None will be returned (signifying that the feature cannot be computed on the provided image)
- Each feature module should have a global variable MODES that is a tuple of accepted image modes (one of  ['1', 'CMYK', 'F', 'I', 'L', 'P', 'RGB', 'RGBA', 'RGBX', 'YCbCr'] taken from PIL's Image.MODES) listed in descending order by preference (first is optimal).  If one is not provided, the module is assumed to accept all modes equally.

def make_features(image):
    return ()
